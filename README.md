**Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Flutter project.

2. Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:

   ```
   flutter create employee_db
   ```

   This will create a new Flutter project named "employee_db."

**Step 2: Add Dependencies**

In your project's `pubspec.yaml` file, add the necessary dependencies:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  sqflite: ^2.0.0
  provider: ^6.0.5
```

Save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run `flutter pub get` to fetch the dependencies.

**Step 3: Create the Employee Class**

Create a Dart file named `employee.dart` in your project's `lib` directory. Define the `Employee` class to represent the structure of employee records. This class will have fields for `id`, `name`, and `position`. Here's an example code for the `Employee` class:

```dart
class Employee {
  int? id;
  String name;
  String position;

  Employee({this.id, required this.name, required this.position});

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() {
    return {
      'id': id,
      'name': name,
      'position': position,
    };
  }

  factory Employee.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
    return Employee(
      id: data['id'],
      name: data['name'],
      position: data['position'],
    );
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Create the Employee Database Helper Class**

Create another Dart file named `employee_database.dart` in your project's `lib` directory. In this file, define the `EmployeeDatabase` class to manage SQLite database operations. This class will handle tasks like database initialization, inserting, querying, updating, and deleting employee records. Here's an example code for the `EmployeeDatabase` class:

```dart
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';

class EmployeeDatabase {
  late Database _database;

  Future<void> initDatabase() async {
    final databasesPath = await getDatabasesPath();
    final path = join(databasesPath, 'employees.db');

    _database = await openDatabase(path, version: 1,
        onCreate: (Database db, int version) async {
      await db.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE employees (
          id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
          name TEXT,
          position TEXT
        )
      ''');
    });
  }

  Future<int> insertEmployee(Employee employee) async {
    await initDatabase();
    return await _database.insert('employees', employee.toMap());
  }

  Future<List<Employee>> getEmployees() async {
    await initDatabase();
    final List<Map<String, dynamic>> maps = await _database.query('employees');

    return List.generate(maps.length, (i) {
      return Employee.fromMap(maps[i]);
    });
  }

  Future<int> updateEmployee(Employee employee) async {
    await initDatabase();
    return await _database.update(
      'employees',
      employee.toMap(),
      where: 'id = ?',
      whereArgs: [employee.id],
    );
  }

  Future<int> deleteEmployee(int id) async {
    await initDatabase();
    return await _database.delete(
      'employees',
      where: 'id = ?',
      whereArgs: [id],
    );
  }

  Future<void> closeDatabase() async {
    await _database.close();
  }
}
```

**Step 5: Create the Main Function and App Structure**

In your project's `main.dart` file, define the main function, `EmployeeApp` class, and the `EmployeeProvider` class. This is where you set up the app's main structure and manage the app's state. Here's an example code for `main.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

import 'employee.dart';
import 'employee_database.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(EmployeeApp());
}

class EmployeeApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: ChangeNotifierProvider(
        create: (context) => EmployeeProvider(),
        child: HomePage(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class EmployeeProvider with ChangeNotifier {
  final EmployeeDatabase _database = EmployeeDatabase();
  List<Employee> employees = [];

  Future<void> refreshEmployees() async {
    employees = await _database.getEmployees();
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  // Implement the UI elements and CRUD operations in this class
  // ...
}
```

**Step 6: Implement the User Interface and CRUD Operations**

In the `HomePage` class (defined in `main.dart`), you'll implement the user interface and CRUD operations for the employee records. You'll use the `EmployeeProvider` to manage the state of the employees' data. Implement the following in this class:

- Create UI elements for displaying employee records and input fields for adding/editing employees.
- Implement CRUD operations (insert, list, update, delete) using the `EmployeeProvider` and `EmployeeDatabase` classes.
- Use dialogs or forms for adding/editing employees.

**Step 7: Testing and Running the App**

Finally, test and run the app on an emulator or physical device. You should be able to add, list, edit, and delete employee records within your Flutter app.

That's it! You've created a simple Flutter app for managing employee records with SQLite and CRUD operations. You can further enhance the app by adding features like search, sorting, and more.
